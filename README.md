# Helicopter Server

Helicopter Server is a project for a causal tree access management system. The server handles the storage and retrieval of nodes in a causal tree, allowing you to easily manage and manipulate the data. In addition to gRPC, Helicopter Server also provides a RESTful API for interacting with the server. The API documentation is provided through Swagger.

## Features

- AddNode: Add a new node to the causal tree with the specified parent and content.
- GetNodes: Retrieve a list of child nodes in a subtree under a specified root node.

## Prerequisites

- Go 1.19 compiler
- Protoc compiler
- Go and gRPC plugins for Protoc

## Try with examples!

We've built cli-messenger as an example of using our server. Also we run ChatGPT chatbot, which listens on chatGPT thread. You can try asking it some prompts yourself!

To build them just run:

```bash
make examples
```

By manipulating contents of the data you can create different apps on top of our causal tree data model. Just use your imagination.

Also you can access our api through swagger: http://ds.sphericalpotatoinvacuum.xyz:8288/swagger/index.html. Or use grpc on ds.sphericalpotatoinvacuum.xyz:1228, refer to [proto/helicopter.proto](https://github.com/InfJoker/helicopter/blob/main/proto/helicopter.proto).

## Getting Started

To get started with the Helicopter Server, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/InfJoker/helicopter.git
cd helicopter
```

2. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
go mod download
```

3. Build the server binary:

```bash
make build
```

4. Start the server:

```bash
./bin/helicopter
```


## Usage

After starting the server, you can interact with it using any gRPC client to call the available RPC methods. For example, you can call the `GetNodes` and `AddNode` methods to retrieve and add nodes in the causal tree.

The default server [config](./configs/config.yml) provides the lseqdb server address. If you wish to turn this feature off then just remove the corresponding config entry, and the server will use non-persistent in-memory [mock storage](./internal/mockstorage/mockstorage.go).

## Testing

To run the tests for the project, use the following command:

```bash
make test
```

To generate a test coverage report, use the following command:

```bash
make coverage
```
